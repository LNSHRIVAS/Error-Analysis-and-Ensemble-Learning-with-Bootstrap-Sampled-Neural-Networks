# Error-Analysis-and-Ensemble-Learning-with-Bootstrap-Sampled-Neural-Networks

This project demonstrates the use of bootstrap sampling to train multiple feedforward neural networks for binary classification on the moon dataset. It includes error rate analysis, visualization through histograms, and the implementation of bagging with varying ensemble sizes to enhance model performance. The repository showcases how ensemble learning can improve classification accuracy and provides insights into the distribution of error rates across models.
